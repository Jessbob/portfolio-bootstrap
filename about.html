          My name is Jesse Whitehead and I live in Topeka, KS with my wonderful
          wife and two kids. I love to invent, design, and build things both
          physically and digitally. I became interested in coding over 25 years
          ago at the age of 12 and the following year our school got the
          internet. Now while most of my classmates were content with simply
          surfing the web, I knew I had to figure out how it all worked. I
          developed websites throughout high school and received a technical
          degree in computer repair and networking. Unfortunately, I didn't
          enjoy it as much and without any local options to pursue web
          development, I went out and got a basic job to pay the bills. That job
          turned into an 18-year career in the optical industry that I enjoyed
          very much. Throughout my career I honed my skills in production flow,
          customer experience, and educating both employees and customers in a
          friendly non-technical approach. One of my biggest achievements was
          developing a lab management database that took us from the old days of
          orders filed away in a filing cabinet to the digital age where
          anything you wanted to know about any order was just a click away.
          This allowed us to expand from two locations to 8 locations with a
          centralized lab to manufacture all the orders. When it was required to
          upgrade our electronic health record system I learned SQL to be able
          to create a lab management interface in one of the most well know EHR
          systems. This saved our employees a lot of time while still being able
          to store and track orders effectively. It was in learning those new
          skills and creating solutions that I realized how much I missed coding
          and developing so I decided to relaunch myself as a web developer.
